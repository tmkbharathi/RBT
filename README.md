#RED BLACK TREE
A redâ€“black tree is a specialised binary search tree data structure noted for fast storage and retrieval of ordered information, and a guarantee that operations will complete within a known time. Compared to other self-balancing binary search trees, the nodes in a red-black tree hold an extra bit called "color" representing "red" and "black" which is used when re-organising the tree to ensure that it is always approximately balanced.
